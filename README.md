Some lisp extensions for Emacs and some dot file stuff.

### files-log.el

Hooks which append text log lines to tracker files whenever a file is opened (one log) or saved (a separate log).
The concept is to allow identification of sets of files that have been consulted or modified.   This was originally
written while studying for my PhD thesis around 1994-1998 so predates git (git was born 3/4/2005) which now 
provides a better way to keep track of work.
